See it running <a href="//sennett.github.io/car">here</a>.</p> <img class="article__fullwidth-image" src="/evolving-car.f8de23f8.png"> <p><span class="article__first-letter">H</span>ere is a personal project combining a simple genetic evolutionary algorithm with a physics engine. The physics engine is used to model a car on a track, and the algorithm then evolves a car that can complete the track. To start, 20 cars are generated randomly and dropped on the track. Because they are generated randomly at the beginning, they don't get very far at first.</p> <div class="article__aside article__aside--right"> To see it running, go <a href="//sennett.github.io/car">here</a> and leave it running for a bit. </div> <p>Each car has a genome. Much like a (very basic) living creature, the genome controls how the car is built and behaves. When all the cars stop moving along the track, the most successful genomes (representing the cars that made it the furthest) are randomly mixed together. This creates 20 more genomes which are turned into cars, and this new generation is run in the physics engine. Grandually, with each generation, the cars get better, and eventually they complete the track.</p> <p>As "machine learning" goes, it's about as simple as you can get. There are no sensors other than the distance travelled by the car, there is no "brain" (no neural network) and the cars make no decisions whilst they're running. But it's interesting. If you remove all the wheels, the cars turn into balls that roll, or they become tall towers that fall over as far as they can. Maybe you have an idea for a game? ðŸ‘‰ hello@southdev.co</p> <hr> </div> </div> </div> </body></html>
